# Advert performance analysis

## Business Understanding

A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. Previously, she ran ads to promote a related course on the same blog and collected data. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads. 

To work on the above problem, I did the following:

1. Defined the question, the metric for success, the context, the experimental design taken, and the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.
2. Found and dealt with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
3. Performed univariate and bivariate analysis.
